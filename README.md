# wbk proposals

As any other collaborative project, we want to draft some proposals before
producing code so that we can have some kind of common guidelines to understand
what we need and what are the components of wbk.

The main idea behind this repository is to collect ideas and proposals
around a new operating system focused on security and with the
specific duty of running Kubernetes in the easiest possible way.

The name "We boot kube" is exactly reflecting this need, it's long and "We securely boot kube" is
even longer so ideally we want to refer to the OS as "wbk" and satellite projects will be "wbk*something*"
like maybe a "wbkctl" if we ever wanted to fight that battle.


So, go ahead, feel free to open issues into this repository if you have time! Remember, this project
is also yours and we can build something together! I'll do my best to polish what I (@fntlnz) did with @leodido
as described in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/fntlnz/status/1264214108007784448?s=20) and push some code to a new `wbk` repository
here. Then we can start from that!
